    "# 🔍 Retrieval Layer (RAG) — Extracting the Correct Proposal Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Objective\n",
    "The Retrieval layer is responsible for **pulling the most relevant text chunks** from proposals so the LLM can generate clean, accurate sections such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Executive Summary  \n",
    "- Background / Context  \n",
    "- Problem / Complication  \n",
    "- Proposed Solution  \n",
    "- Approach / Methodology  \n",
    "- Costing & Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "For this POC we are generating only executive summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since every proposal has its own structure and formatting, retrieval must be **robust, hybrid, and section-aware**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From vectostore we are pully most relevant executive summary which will help LLM to understand how real proposal's executive summary is written and then we will also pass client's relevant executive summary or any other section to copy the firm's tone and maintain that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to achieve 2 things here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Learn from actual proposals how each section is written and\n",
    "2) Maintain the tone of the firm so that it should not look like genarte by some genral pusrpose LLMs."
